========================================
üìå POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA
========================================

Polymorphism = "One name, many forms"

TYPES:
----------------------------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism
   - Achieved by METHOD OVERLOADING.
   - Same method name, but parameter list differs 
     (number, type, or order of parameters).
   - Decided by the compiler at compile time.
   - Example: Multiple constructors.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run-Time (Dynamic) Polymorphism
   - Achieved by METHOD OVERRIDING.
   - Child class has a method with the SAME signature as the parent,
     but different implementation.
   - Which method runs is decided at runtime based on OBJECT TYPE.
   - Rules:
       üîπ Final methods cannot be overridden.
       üîπ Static methods cannot be overridden (only hidden).
       üîπ Access level in child must not be more restrictive.

----------------------------------------
‚öô IMPORTANT:
- Reference Type (left side of =) ‚Üí Decides which members can be accessed.
- Object Type (right side of =)   ‚Üí Decides which overridden method runs.

Example:
Shapes s = new Circle();
s.area(); // Runs Circle‚Äôs area() because object is Circle.
