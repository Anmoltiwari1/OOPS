     *     public Test(String name) {

     *
     * Then this inner class would be tied to an object of "InnerClasses".
     * This means:
     * - You CANNOT create an object of Test without first creating
     *   an object of InnerClasses.
     * - Syntax would be:
     *      InnerClasses outer = new InnerClasses();
     *      InnerClasses.Test obj = outer.new Test("Hello");
     *
     * This is because non-static inner classes carry a hidden reference
     * to the outer class object.

    /*
     * ‚úÖ STATIC Inner Class:
     * By adding "static" before class Test, we make it an independent
     * nested class that does NOT depend on an object of Outer Class.
     * 
     * Key differences from non-static inner class:
     * - No hidden reference to Outer class object.
     * - Can be created directly using:
     *      InnerClasses.Test obj = new InnerClasses.Test("Hello");
     * - Useful for grouping classes logically, without tying their lifecycle
     *   to an instance of the outer class.
