//When we have to commbine different parameters into single enetity then we can do it with the classes
//If have to create oure own data type we can do it using classes
//class-->a name group of properties and functions
//class--> means a template basically ,from which differnet things are formed for example:
//          class is-->engine,price,seats for a car now from this basic template we can form differnet cars like audi,bmw etc

//hence class is template of object and object is instance of class

//class-->logical contruct ,not in physical ,not in reality(like humans is a class)
//object-->it is physical reality derived from class

//instance variable-->Varibake inside the object called instance variables

// '.' operator-->linking class with object
public class Classes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
    //kunal will have 3 properties (rno,name and marks)
    Student kunal;
    
}
//class creation
class Student{
    int[] rno=new int[5];
    String[] name=new String[5];
    float[] marks=new float[5];
}
